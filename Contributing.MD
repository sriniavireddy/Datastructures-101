How to Contribute
==================

## Solutions

Please **do not send pull requests for replacing my code**. If you'd like to contribute [solutions](https://github.com/sriniavireddy/Datastructures-101-solutions), please see the following instructions:

- Solve the problem, and keep it in your repo. DO NOT send merge request yet.

- Find the problem in this [README](https://github.com/sriniavireddy/Datastructures-101-solutions/blob/master/README.md) file.

- Edit the file in this format (notice the double square brackets):

    \**This is a problem** - And here goes it's description. \[[LinkedList (language)]]\(link-to-LinkedList-solution) \[[your_username (Java)]]\(link-to-your-solution)
    
    This results in something like this:
    
    **This is a problem** - And here goes it's description. [[LinkedList (language)]](link-to-LinkedList-solution) [[your_username (Java)]](link-to-your-solution)

- Please respect other people and do not delete or move anyone else's link. Place your solution at the end of the list of solutions.

- Save/Commit the README.md file.

- Send a pull request for this commit ONLY - ie, the commit to the [solutions repo](https://github.com/sriniavireddy/Datastructures-101-solutions)!


## Projects

If you have suggestions for adding or removing projects, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/sriniavireddy/Datastructures-101/issues/new) to discuss it, or directly create a pull request after you edit the *README.md* file with necessary changes. If you add a problem, make sure you add it in the correct category.

It is required that any changes made to the projects (this does not include adding solutions) in *README.md*, must be reflected in the [Solutions *README.md* file](https://github.com/thekarangoel/Projects-Solutions/blob/master/README.md)

If you're copying a project from some other webpage, you **MUST** link to it in the *Sources* section at the bottom of repo's *README.md* and *README-scratch.md*.
