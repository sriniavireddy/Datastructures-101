# Interesting List of DataStructure problems
Solutions to Most common datastructure based problems in multiple languages

Data Structures List
========

A list of most common datastructures problems that anyone can solve in any programming language (See [solutions](https://github.com/sriniavireddy/Datastructures-101-solutions)). These projects are divided in multiple categories, and each category has its own folder.

To get started, simply fork this repo.
